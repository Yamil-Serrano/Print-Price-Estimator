# Print Price Estimator

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly tool to calculate the total cost of a 3D print based on various input parameters such as filament price, filament usage, electricity cost, and printing time. The **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** is designed for ease of use, allowing quick entry of values and immediate cost calculation.

## Key Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Simplifies cost estimation with an easy-to-navigate layout.
- **Filament Cost Calculation**: Estimates the cost based on filament price per kilogram and filament usage in grams.
- **Energy Cost Calculation**: Computes energy consumption based on printer power consumption and local electricity rates.
- **Failure Rate**: Incorporates a customizable failure rate to reflect potential print errors and their associated costs.
- **Instant Results**: Displays the total cost including filament and energy use, as well as any additional failure rate adjustments.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yamil-Serrano/Print-Price-Estimator.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Enter Values**: Input your 3D print parameters, including filament price, filament used (g), print time, electricity price, and printer power consumption.
  
2. **Failure Rate**: Optionally, enter a percentage failure rate to adjust the cost calculation for potential errors in the printing process.
  
3. **View Results**: Once all values are entered, press the "Calculate Price" button, and the estimated cost will be displayed on the right side of the interface.
